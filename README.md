On the screen is an empty billiard table with sections where you can place a ball (6 sections).
To the right are chaotically arranged balls of different shades.
The player's task, based on the gradient at the top of the screen (the transition from light to dark or vice versa) position the balls on the table in the order of brightening/darkening.
The balls can be placed or removed until the desired combination is achieved.



The ball is set as follows: tap on the ball outside the table - tap on the section.
The ball is removed as follows: tap on the ball on the table.

After successful passing a window pops up with an offer to go to the next level: “Next Level” / “Следующий уровень”; and an offer to return to the menu: “Menu” и “Меню”.
Also, after passing the previously closed levels, they open in the section "Levels".
